# Using Python with Stata (via Files)

In many cases it can be convenient to keep `stata` and `python`
workflows largely independent of each other such as:

1. Dataset Construction (Python)
2. Statistical Modelling (Stata)

```{note}
If `data` needs to be computed regularly due to updates. The
`python script` interface in `stata` is useful here as it can
be used to update `data` using a `python script` before running
any `regressions`.
