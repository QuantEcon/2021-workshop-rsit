:::{admonition} Resource Development
I am interested in turning these workshop materials into a resource on using
`stata` and `python` together for the broader community.

Any feedback, ideas or suggested improvements are most welcome!
:::

One of the major new features of [Stata16](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/)
is [python integration](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/python-integration/).

There are `two` main ways we can use `python` effectively with `stata`:

1. [Using **python** in **stata** (through integrated workflows)](session5/stata-and-python-integrated)
2. [Using **stata** with **python** (via file based workflows)](session5/stata-and-python-files)]

```{seealso}
We will also look at alternative ways to use `stata` and `python` in the
[next session](session7/stata-and-jupyter) through `jupyter` using `stata`
kernels.
```
