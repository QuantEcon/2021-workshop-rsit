```{admonition} Aims & Outcomes:
1. Use `DataFrames`
2. Use `introspection` to look at the `methods` that can be applied
3. Learn how to look up the documentation / manuals
```

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is the foundational package for data analysis in `python`.

The official [pandas manual](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is an excellent resource

Here is [the QuantEcon lecture on Pandas](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/pandas.html)

We will work through the following `pandas` demo notebook.

```{note}
You will be spending a lot more time with `pandas` in addition sessions.

It is the workhorse package for any work with `data` in `python`.
```
