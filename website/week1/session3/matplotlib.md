# Matplotlib

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is the foundational package for plotting in `python`.

A [useful gallery of examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) can be a good place
to see what is possible when building plots and visualisations with `matplotlib`

Here is [the QuantEcon lecture on matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)

We will work through the following `matplotlib` demo notebook.
