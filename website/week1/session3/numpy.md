# NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org) is the foundational package for numerical computing in `python`.

It brings the computational power of underlying `C` and `Fortran` libraries to `python` and
makes them accessible in a high productivity language.

Here is [the QuantEcon lecture on NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)

We will work through the following `numpy` notebook.
