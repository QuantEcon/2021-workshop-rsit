# NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org) is the foundational package for numerical computing in `python`.

In essence it brings the computational power of underlying `C` and `Fortran` libraries to `python` and
makes them accessible in a high productivity setting.

[NumPy](https://numpy.org) also defines the standard interfaces for `array` based programming across the ecosystem.

```{admonition} Resource
Here is [the QuantEcon lecture on NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
```

We will work through the following `numpy` notebook.

## Local Option

You can download the {download}`notebook from here <../../../notebooks/session3/intro-to-numpy.ipynb>`

Then browse to your download location and load the notebook with **jupyter**:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
jupyter notebook intro-to-numpy.ipynb
```

## Cloud Based Option

You can [launch the notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QuantEcon/2021-workshop-rsit/main?filepath=notebooks%2Fsession1%2Fintro-to-numpy.ipynb)

```{tip}
The [NumPy](https://numpy.org) library is used extensively across the `quantecon` lecture
series and is used to cover topics such as:

1. [Linear Algebra](https://python.quantecon.org/linear_algebra.html)
