# Introduction to Python for Economics

## Why Python?

### Proprietary vs Open Source

**Matlab** and **Stata** are very useful platforms.

### Choice of Programming Languages


## Scientific Computing

**Scientific Computing** ultimately demands:

1. high productivity
2. a high degree of customisation to adapt to various domains
3. (possible) high compute power

One of the strengths of `python` is its adaptability to various
contexts.
