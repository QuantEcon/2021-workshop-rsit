    "    `join`.  \n",
    "  - Hint 2: `customer_type` is always one of `Returning` and\n",
    "    `First-time`.  \n",
    "  - Hint 3: Some customers don’t have a\n",
    "    `customer_type == \"First-time\"` entry. You will need to set the\n",
    "    value for these users to some date that precedes the dates in the\n",
    "    sample. After adding valid data back into `orders` DataFrame,\n",
    "    you can identify which customers don’t have a `\"First-Time\"`\n",
    "    entry by checking for missing data in the new column.  \n",
    "1. You’ll need to group by 3 things.  \n",
    "1. You can apply one of the built-in aggregation functions to the GroupBy.  \n",
    "1. After doing the aggregation, you’ll need to use your reshaping skills to\n",
